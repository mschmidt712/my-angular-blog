    "Oh, the Middle Fork. What is not to love? Continuous white water, beautiful scenery, riverside hot springs… not to mention good food and good friends. It has to be one of my favorite places in the world (or what I have seen of the world).",
    "And this trip was an EVENTFUL one. We definitely had our ups and downs. To start it all off, the Middle Fork has a boat launch like I have never seen before. I’ll try and add a picture to describe it better than I can… But it is basically a giant boat slide made out of huge logs. It’s been worn down over time, the thing has to be at least 30 - 40 years old, so you are basically launching your boat down a polished wooden slide into moving class 3 whitewater. And on top of the technical difficulty of the thing, you are trying to get boats into the water at top speed so you don’t slow down the boat train waiting behind you. It’s stressful and we were stressed. So, picture us moving at top speed, throwing things into our little boats and launching them down the slide. I’m going to give you all a little hint. When the boat gains momentum at a 30 – 40 degree angle, things that aren’t strapped down will probably move… This was the unfortunate fate of my brand new camp table, and let me tell you those things ain’t cheap. The boat started to slide and “WOOSH” the table rocketed off, right into the moving water, and “glunk, glunk, glunk” sunk down to the bottom of the river to be found for some lucky low water trip. This got things off to a bit of a rocky start, I was sad, the group was sad, and mostly my wallet was sad.",
    "After a filing dinner and a good nights sleep we had mostly moved on. Onto day 1 of our trip. A little background info on Day 1. It is a rowdy day in terms of white water, the first five miles are continuous class 3 / 4 white water with very few eddies at our water level of 5.5 ft. You are moving down stream with very little margin for error, then you hit Velvet Falls at mile 5. This is a notorious rapid, with a pretty much river wide ledge hole. It has been the flipper of many boats in the past and we were no exception (just wait for it!). After Velvet Falls, the water slows down a bit and you get some recovery room between the remaining big drops. So let’s get to it! ",
    "I was leading the pack, and right out of the gates “BOOM” I perched myself on a rock. This was embarrassing, but what made it humiliating was that said rock was in direct sight of the boat ramp. So not only did my trip all see me, but every other group saw me as well… and watched me and my crew wiggle ourselves off of the rock slowly but surely. With the boat freed, we starting catching back up to the others. This got a bit spicy, as one of my oars was cocked horizontal to the water, something I probably should have noticed BEFORE pushing into the water. No matter. We got that fixed and everyone was running nice and tight with good lines! Then we got to Velvet. It was chaos. I had my crew paddling forward as I was pulling backward. We hit an odd lateral on the left side and popped out miraculously unscathed. Bob seemed much more together than me, and ran a clean line to the left. Vaughn looked petrified as he pulled back so hard he was almost stalled at the top of the drop. He ended up coming around nicely to the left. Three of four boats through! Then came Kyle… At this point I am around the corner with no line of sight, but Bob had a GoPro on and got this on film. Word has it Kyle ran just a bit too far to the right, made it through, then got sucked back in and flipped. So this all happens, and we hear the whistle and it is right into rescue mode. We pull off as fast as we can and pick up, Kathy, a floating passenger. Meanwhile, Kyle and Alicia, the other two passengers, are riding on top of the boat trying to flip it back. But it is a heavy SOB. Two people is not enough. So we hang back and help Kathy catch her breathe, while Bob and Vaughn chase the flipped boat downstream. In the end it took four people and 5 miles to get the boat back over! Nobody was hurt and the rescue was successful but boy did it put the Middle Fork in perspective.",
    "After this long haul of a day, we are itching for camp and some dry clothes when we pull into the tiniest of eddies, with a STEEP hill to a grassy bench. But not grassy in a nice, inviting way. Grassy in a tick-infested, 3ft tall, no camping spots kind of way. So now, about 24 hours into the trip, we have lost a table, flipped a boat, and gotten what must be the worst camp spot on the river. Thank god we had a delicious, buttery berry cobbler for dessert that night or I think it might have been mutiny.",
    "Not to worry though! From here the trip really turned around! Day 2 we had 20 miles of fun and exciting rapids with all clean lines and a beautiful camp spot. Day 3 was equally perfect with a great hot springs stop along the river (equipped with a HOT SPRINGS SHOWER!). And, we finagled our way into a great large camp on night 3 by offering to share the camp with a small group of Canadians. Boy was that a great decision! First of all, the camp was beautiful, and we were in easy walking distance of Big Loon Hot Springs, my favorite hot spring on the river. Second, there was an amazing group of palominos that roamed the field behind camp and they loved to be petted. Third, the Canadians were a great group of people. They were part of some rescue organization so they all came decked out in crazy garb. At least two throw bags per person, full dry gear, and a rescue life vests. Despite all their gear, their boating skills were a bit greener. We learned that they flipped or dumped passengers on 4 of 5 boats at Velvet! It made us feel a bit better about our one little incident . It was also, coincidently Canada Day on that next morning so they led us all in the Canadian anthem and we started our day with fine Canadian whiskey shots. Fun times.",
    "Then came day 4… I promised my dad I wouldn’t blab about this but the story is really too good to pass up. Day 4 was just another day of fun splashy white water and a great camp site. We pulled into our camp around 3pm and were amazed with it! It was huge, and had tons of great camping spots, and the guide book said it had a great hike. Once the kitchen and group gear was set up, Bob, Whitney, Vaughn and I set out on the hike. All the canyon walls along the Middle Fork are steep so I knew it wouldn’t be a walk in the park, but I was not prepared for what it was. It was STEEP. And completely unrelenting. It must have been four times, we thought “This is awful, but there is the top!” just be realize it was another false summit. By the time we got to the top we had all shed as many clothes as decently possible and were completely out of water. It was heinous. Beautiful view! But heinous. I posted a couple pictures above of the view down the canyon and of course a beautiful selfie of all the survivors! The way down was probably worse than the way up, but we all made it alive. As we pulled back into camp though… I began to wish that I hadn’t made it back down. We were quickly greeted by a concerned Alicia – “There are people on the beach and they say this is their camp site!”. For a little fill-in, on the Middle Fork all campsites are assigned before put-in and there is typically only one group per camp. This meant that either we were at the wrong camp, or they were. I bet you guessed it… it was us. No one is quite sure how it happened, but we whole-heartedly had convinced ourselves we were camping at Little Pine, even though our permit had us listed for Sheep Creek. Not one, not two, but 6 miles upstream! So here we find ourselves, 7pm with a hostile group on the beach, and ourselves in the wrong camp. What do you do in a situation like this but try and kill them with kindness? It was too late for either group to go downstream so we were stuck. Completely stuck and totally in the wrong, we did our best to be accommodating. We moved our kitchen up the beach so they could have the best spot and we crowded all our tents onto the shelf so they could have the shorter carry. Really, there was plenty of space for both our groups but the tension was high and the situation was incredibly awkward. They were clearly PO’d that we were there and they wanted us to know it. I’ve been in situations like this in the past and typically, once both groups get comfortable and adapt to the situation things sort of blow over. Not here! We offered them beer – they looked at us like we were crazy. We offered them dessert – they shoo’ed us away. We gave it our best shot to make friends, but they weren’t having it. The only saving grace was that these people were late to sleep, late to rise so we were basically able to get up, eat, load the boats, and shove off all before they even got out of bed. They were not a very friendly group of people, and they clearly hated us, but at least we were out of there and didn’t have to see them again… until we did.",
    "Day 5 was filled with great white water and we were able to get into camp at noon for a lunch-over (where you make lunch in camp and don’t have to get back on the boats). We had a whole beautiful afternoon to sleep, read, fish, and play in the water and we were all starting to brush off our poor encounter the night before.  Until, guess who rolls into our camp but our fr-enemies from upstream! There was a very neat 5.9+ crack climb across the river from our camp that one of their party was looking to climb, so in they rolled. No hello, no greeting at all, just a couple boats and cold hard silence. We didn’t expect much more from these people, so we left them on their way. The real concern came when a couple of their party hiked back up from downstream to yell at us that we were in the “wrong f**king camp again!”. No matter that this was not THEIR campsite, so even if we were it was none of their business, but of course we were not. You better believe after the night before we double, nay, triple checked to make sure we were in the right camp! Even though we set them straight, it was still a bit of a downer on our night to have to deal with those people and their bad attitudes again. I swore I would moon them the next day when we went by… but I chickened out.",
    "After our last little bit of excitement, we had a great dinner, great conversation, and an exciting but uneventful last day on the water. We got some fun footage of a big rapid just before takeout that I hope to get up here soon. Overall, a trip of a lifetime and definitely one that I will not forget (for the good, the bad, and the ugly)! Thanks for tuning in and I hope you got at least a bit of humor from our fortunes and misfortunes!"],
